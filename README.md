# French Flashcard App

This is a simple French flashcard app built with Python tkinter. The app allows users to create flashcards with French words or phrases on one side, and their English translations on the other. Users can then practice their French by flipping through the flashcards and trying to recall the English translations.

## Usage

To start the app, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you've saved the `flashcards.py` file. Then run the following command:

`python main.py`

The app will open and you can start creating your own flashcards. To add a new flashcard, click the "Add Card" button and fill out the form with your French word or phrase and its English translation. To flip through the flashcards, click the "Next Card" button. You can also edit or delete existing flashcards by selecting them from the list and clicking the corresponding button.
